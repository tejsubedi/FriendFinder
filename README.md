# FriendFinder

# Overview

In this activity, I have developed a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application --basically a dating app where the application has 10 questions of user's choosing and each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question. . The app will take in results from  users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.



# Technology Used
 **JavaScript, Node, NPM: express, mathjs, path**
